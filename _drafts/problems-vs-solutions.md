## Solutions

Solutions are everywhere. Innovations catalog etc. Cheap, easy to dream up. X meets Y.

Solutions are lauded even if they're shit ideas. Rape drug nail varnish.

Problems have baked in social text. Problems are complex and messy and require talking to people.

Solutions are implemented with technology. Easy, clean.

Problems are researched outside the tech/business sector
