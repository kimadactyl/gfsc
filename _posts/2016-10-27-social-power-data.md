I went to a film screening and discussion on Wednesday about Mark Duggan's death, and the circumstances surrounding him and his family. The film and event was one of the best screenings I've been to. The documentary itself was authentic, engaging, and honest, showing a slice of life in London with the same skill as an episode of _The Wire_ (more on that later). The discussion after was a real eye-opener for me though: many speakers across two panels with so much to share and say. At the same time, I was rolling an idea around for this blogpost for Open Data Manchester's _[Echo chambers and post-fact politics](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/echo-chambers-and-post-fact-politics-how-can-we-make-evidence-and-politics-work-better-together-tickets-27755539566)_ event.

Body-worn cameras (BWCs) came up in the discussion at the end. A recent study showed that the presence of BWCs reduces complaints against officers by 93%{% sidenote ariel [Ariel, B. et. al. (2016). “Contagious Accountability”: A Global Multisite Randomized Controlled Trial on the Effect of Police Body-Worn Cameras on Citizens’ Complaints Against the Police. Criminal Justice and Behavior. ](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/260710/Ariel_et_al-Journal_of_Criminal_Justice_and_Behavior-AM.pdf?sequence=1)%}. The reasons for the reduction are still under debate, but the authors propose an idea of "contagious accountability". The paper's methodology was to get half of the shifts at participating police forces to wear BWCs, and the other not to as a control group. One key finding was that both the control and treatment groups had a marked reduction in complains. The authors suggest that the introduction of BWCs engendered an atmosphere of officers obeying the rules, and being more accountable, even if they were not wearing the cameras.

And yet the anecdotal but widely corroborated feeling at the event was that the police are still stop and searching young black people illegally{% sidenote illegal Not providing proper documentation for the stop and search %}, even wearing the BWCs: the children and young adults simply don't know what the procedure is so they don't ask for it. The BWC footage isn't reviewed because, as someone put it, if noone gets shot, noone looks at the footage.

Then it hit me: we have all the data. Much as racism is meaningless without social power{% marginnote %}I use the definition that "[...] racism is _prejudice plus power_, and therefore people of colour cannot be racist against whites [...]. People of colour can be prejudiced against whites, but clearly do not as a group have the power to enfore that prejudice" [(Katz, 2003)](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yoFHSXoofoQC&lpg=PA43&pg=PA52&redir_esc=y&hl=en#v=onepage&q&f=false){% endmarginnote %}, so too is data it seems.

We have an enormous amount of data spanning decades on the institutional racism in the UK. 1578 deaths in police custody or following contact with the police since 1990, with 0 convictions{% sidenote policedeaths [inquest.org.uk](http://www.inquest.org.uk/statistics/deaths-in-police-custody) %}. Employment rates. Stop and search. Social chances.

All technology is a product of it's social context, and the agendas of the people creating it. So why do we not have community data initiatives? Why do tech events so poorly represent the communities within which they are hosted? Why do we have so much data, and so little progress?

Tin Geber asks people to _stop making apps to help refugees_{% sidenote geber [Geber (2016). _Hackathon and refugees: we can do better_](https://openmigration.org/en/op-ed/hackathon-and-refugees-we-can-do-better/) %}. The police bodycams show that all this data is meaningless without social power to back it up. But our neoliberal tech sector wants solutions as simple as the ones the press is peddling, without regard for if they work or not. Businesses (even Social Enterprises and charities) primarily measure success in money, not any other metric. And I see almost no coders or people in high level tech jobs at activist events or engaged in community groups that are to do with anything other than code.

This has to change. As technologists, innovators, and academics, we need to be drawn not to the extreme, exciting, new, or sexy: but to the needs of our community. We need to spend a lot more time listening and engaging and being part of solutions. We need to each each other, be compassionate, talk about lacks, and look to without not within to understand and help with problems. Borrowing Freire's critique of education, "good" in the sense of social good is not a bucket you fill, in order to deliver it to someone who needs it. Good is reaching out to other people on their terms and helping us solve our problems together. I feel there can be no real solutions that don't address both the stark contrast between online and physical communities, and the erosure of the subtle in favour of the instant headline.

By throwing away experts and rational decision making, those in power have the freedom to do basically what they want. In both cases, the "powers that be" flagrantly ignored data, public opinion, and community demands, in favour of simply deciding to _ignore it all_. It was pointed out in the Q&A that police have now been wearing body cameras for a long time, as a direct repercussion of police violence, and that is has had no effect on illegal stop and search as _nobody with power cares about the data_.
