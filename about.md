title: About Dr. Kim Foale
description: My skills and experience
---

I have experience in a number of areas and bring skills from over a decade's experience to bear on any given problem. The rest of this website describes my rationale and approach; this page is to give an idea of the detail of what I use to achieve this{% sidenote cv You can also view my [CV on Google Documents](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ofbAjqmpJL4o2SIsWV7OCNYslB1ymfVd9lt7G9E-ViU/edit?usp=sharing) %}.

## Research

I'm a primarily qualitative researcher, specialising in Grounded Theory-based coding methods. I prefer working with projects in their initial stages, developing concrete products from ephemeral ideas.

I'm experienced in related technologies like NVivo (although I prefer to build my own solutions), SPSS and OpenRefine, and publish mostly in $$\LaTeX$$.

## Development

I deliver a range of development services from full-stack web development, to video and media production and experimental production methods. I'm fluent in the following technologies and quick to learn new ones as needed for any given project.

### Platforms


[**Drupal**](https://www.drupal.com/), a highly mature open-source CMS. I use this where a lot of functionality is needed on a limited budget{% sidenote katescuttings [Example Drupal site](http://katescuttings.net/) %}.

[**Ruby on Rails**](http://rubyonrails.org/), a platform for building webapps. I use this for projects with lots of custom functionality, where a high degree of customisation is required{% sidenote taichi [Example Rails site](http://taichi.school/) %}.

[**Sinatra**](http://www.sinatrarb.com/), a simple framework for making webapps. I use this for smaller projects that focus on doing one thing really well{% sidenote noiseater [Example Sinatra site](http://noiseeater.net/) %}.

**Static site generators** such as [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/){% sidenote self This site runs on Jekyll %}, Middleman and Metalsmith. I use these for creating "brochure sites" or simple blogs. I'm a huge fan of static site generators.

[**Ghost**](https://ghost.org/), an excellent blogging platform{% sidenote allicalm [I use this for my personal blog](http://alliscalm.net/) %}.

 I do not use Wordpress: I think there is almost always a more appropriate solution, and believe it is one of the industry's most mis-sold solutions{% sidenote wordpress Proper article on this coming soon %}. In short, it almost always ends up being insecure, bloated, slow, and poorly engineered. I'm happy to debate with you about why though and show you how other solutions will solve your problem better!

### Languages and technologies

 * JavaScript and jQuery
 * Databases: MySQL, Postgresql
 * CSS: SASS, LESS, Susy&hellip;
 * HTML5: HAML, ERB, Mustache&hellip;
 * Accessible design (design for all abilities)
 * Responsive design (design for all devices)
 * Behaviour Driven Development (I write code to test my code)

### Marketing, PR etc

 * Facebook and Twitter strategy
 * Communications strategy

## Activism

I primarily see myself as an activist, and many of the projects I've done "in my spare time" are those I'm the proudest of.

  * Director and volunteer at Oblong (now Woodhouse Community Centre), a community resource centre in Leeds. Managed and supported their computer suite, did IT training, and participated in the strategic management of the organisation.
  * Various LGBTQ+ and feminist organising. I've been involved in lots of Ladyfests and queer events, ran a community cafe for 4 years, created tech solutions for festivals and zine distros, etc. Most notably I was communications director and web developer for the First National Festival of LGBT History in 2015{% sidenote lgbtf Site returning soon! %}
  * Founder of [Dear Friend](http://dearfriend.org.uk), a letter-writing project celebrating women in public life and liberation
  * Concept and design behind [Hulme History](http://hulmehistory.info), an experimental map-based local history timeline{% sidenote hulmehistory I've [written a lengthy piece on my rationale for this](http://alliscalm.net/stop-making-pincushion-maps/) on my blog %}.

I'm still not quite sure how to present this information -- an activist CV of sorts -- we live in a culture where paid products are seen as the yardstick and it's hard to quantify involvement in social movements. If anyone has any ideas please get in touch!
