The internet promised to be a utopia, a place where all were equal and ideas shared freely. Much like physical space, it has turned out to be the reverse: an unequal, unfair, increasingly private space where a few billionaire investors set the context and standard for the web as a whole. And much like physical space, the needs of the few not the many are celebrated and promoted, while community groups and organisations for progressive social good are left in the dust. We are entering an era where our online and physical identities are one and the same, without the proper tools to critically evaluate this as engaged citizens.

We have a solution-focussed culture of invention and entrepreneurship, where solutions are valorized above understanding problems. Hackdays and “tech for good” initiatives’ problem-identifying skills bring to mind the ridiculous setups for infomercials selling over-engineered solutions to simple problems.

In reality, real social change is hard. Taking an asset-based approach, any given problem generally already has multiple groups engaged in solving it. Lean approaches tend to focus only on the practice of producing a product. To engage with social issues, we need to understand the history of what has happened before, what’s worked (or not), and who the key stakeholders are.
