Geeks for Social Change is an initiative led by Dr. Kim Foale{% sidenote about-me [Personal blog](http://alliscalm.net) %}, focussing on achieving measurable social change through activist, academic, and technological knowledge. I take a holistic approach to research, technology, and activism, aiming to use the best of all of them to create a fairer world. I have over a decade’s experience as both a web practitioner and community activist, and hold a social science PhD{% sidenote thesis <a href="http://usir.salford.ac.uk/32043/1/thesis-11-07-14-with-corrections-even-margins.pdf">Link to my doctoral thesis</a> %}. I’ve been involved in dozens of groups focussing on human rights and environmental issues, and created dozens of websites{% sidenote portfolio Partial portfolio [on my website](http://alliscalm.net/tag/portfolio/) %} for community organisations, universities, and businesses (including my own{% sidenote taichi-school [Tai Chi School](http://taichi.school) %}).

## About Geeks for Social Change

I established GFSC in response to an increasing frustration at the lack of communication between the spheres I work in: an activist sector lagging behind in terms of technology, academia focussed on research impact and publications rather than actual social change, and a tech sector largely focussed on its own technological progress, rather than broader social themes.

## My Approach

I want to engage with these issues by working with people and organisations of all types, to transform society for the better. I want to challenge the client/agency status quo, and build a different kind of praxis: one that works with people to achieve social change, using all our knowledge to build holistic products we are all a part of. I believe that the most pressing job of technologists and researchers now is to help facilitate communities and organisations to create their own solutions.

## Work with me

I work exclusively with clients who want to create measurable social change. We do this together, as a partnership. Client/agency relationships broken. Unlike other agencies that say tho do things differently, we spell out how and why.

Community, academic, tech, should be tight-knit, responding to each other’s needs. The clarion call for Lean doesn’t go far enough - should be within and without. Tech doesn’t exist without social text - combine action research, community activism, tech, to make best results for all.
