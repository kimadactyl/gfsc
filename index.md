description: Working towards a fairer society using technology, communication, and education.

Geeks for Social Change is an initiative led by Dr. Kim Foale{% sidenote about-me [Personal blog](http://alliscalm.net) %}, focussing on achieving measurable social change through activist, academic, and technological knowledge. It is an experimental approach to a different kind of agency -- a practice primarily built on ethical grounds rather than financial ones{% sidenote business-vs-ethics The two are, of course, [uncomfortable bedfellows](https://www.opendemocracy.net/transformation/michael-edwards/why-it-s-time-to-say-goodbye-to-doing-good-and-doing-well) %} that prioritises transparency and service provision over shiny marketing and product delivery.

I take a holistic approach to research, technology, and activism, aiming to use the best of all of them to create a fairer world. I have over a decade’s experience as both a web practitioner and community activist, and hold a social science PhD{% sidenote thesis <a href="http://usir.salford.ac.uk/32043/1/thesis-11-07-14-with-corrections-even-margins.pdf">Link to my doctoral thesis</a> %}. I’ve been involved in dozens of groups focussing on human rights and environmental issues, and created dozens of websites{% sidenote portfolio Partial portfolio [on my website](http://alliscalm.net/tag/portfolio/) %} for community organisations, universities, and businesses (including my own{% sidenote taichi-school [Tai Chi School](http://taichi.school) %}).

## About Geeks for Social Change

I established GFSC in response to an increasing frustration at the lack of communication between the spheres I work in. These are an activist sector extremely slow to utilize new technologies, an academic sector focussed on research impact and publications rather than engaging in social change, and a tech sector mostly invested in technological progress for the rich rather than innovating to solve social problems.

It's an attempt to open up the development process, placing ethics first and being transparent about what I do and how I do it.

## My Approach

I want to engage with social issues by working with people and organisations of all types, to transform society for the better. I want to challenge the current client/agency relationship and build a different kind of praxis: one that works with communities to achieve social change, using all our knowledge to build holistic solutions and deeper understandings of social problems. I believe that the most pressing job of technologists and researchers should be to help facilitate communities and organisations to create their own solutions.
