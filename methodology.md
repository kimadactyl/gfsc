As you've probably noticed by now, the layout and tone of this site is fairly academic. That's for a reason. I want to escape quick-fix branding solutions and the pressures of being on-message, and give the issues the attention they deserve. I think we need this level of critical discourse in order to seriously upset the current status quo. The rest of this piece is fairly academic and theory-driven, but don't be afraid to simply get in touch if anything I've written chimes true!

## Academic background

My PhD used Grounded Theory as a methodology to understand how people listen to the sounds of the built environment. Grounded Theory (GT) was "discovered"{% sidenote gt [Glaser &amp; Strauss (1967)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Discovery_of_Grounded_Theory) %} in the 1960s by two researchers outlining a possible approach to iterative problem solving. The orginal text, while inspirational, leaves a little to be desired on detail, explored later by many authors in greater detail.

Nowadays I'd describe my outlook as more like critical theory, or structuralist -- but the core concept is the same, that when exploring new ideas or areas, we should do research by absorbing everything around us, using an inductive not deductive methodology.

Agile and Lean, two inescapable buzzwords in today's tech world, owe almost everything to this approach, even if they don't know it themselves. Reading _Running Lean_{% sidenote mayura [Mauyra (2012)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Running-Lean-Iterate-Works-OReilly/dp/1449305172) %}, the whole thing reminded me of a stripped-back, business-focussed version of Strauss and Corbin's (1990) later version of Grounded Theory{% sidenote gt2 [Basics of Qualitative Research: Techniques and Procedures for Developing Grounded Theory](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Basics-Qualitative-Research-Techniques-Procedures/dp/1412997461/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) %}.

Ask qualitively, verify quantatively; interviews as the primary method of data gathering; using all the tools at your disposal to understand needs; and ideas of how to measure what people are telling you are all key to both concepts. Grounded Theory adds more in terms of theoretical depth, telling you how to build robust, thick theory using qualitative data. Lean methods focus more on how to turn this information into profit -- and this is by far the most dominant cultural paradigm emerging from the tech scene at the moment.

## Digital strategy is just strategy

Many groups that come to me: activist groups, NGOs, charities and CICs have never seriously engaged with marketing, PR, and technology as a whole. Due in large part to a lack of vocabulary, education, skills, and training, organisations don't know what to ask for or what they need. The most common scenario I encounter is where people have got a moderate amount of money (let's say £2,000 - £5,000) to develop "a website", with the optimistic belief that this website will solve all their problems, with little effort on behalf of the client.

Except, of course, it doesn’t. As a “web developer”, in a team of one or two, my job historically has consisted of any or all of the following:

 * Commissioning branding and logo design
 * Creating communications strategies and marketing plans
 * Creating information architecture and institutional vocabulary
 * Doing training for social media, CMS platforms, and copywriting
 * Copywriting
 * Setting up email systems, migrating organisations to cloud storage, setting up mailing lists and CRMs, etc.
 * And of course, the design and build of the website - a complex, multifaceted job in itself.

This clearly sets up a huge power imbalance, and requires readjustment on both sides.

Our combined work should therefore start before technology has even been invoked. By focussing on our “real world” objectives, away from the immediate constraints of why

## Timelines

Unrealistic timelines due to unrealistic expectations

## Simplest possible solution/MVP

Often the simple solutions are the best. Low budget necessitates anyway. Easy to dream up huge platforms but strip back and do the simplest possible thing first (MVP)

##  Agile starts at home

You’ve already thought about this/maybe have a site/idea already. We develop from that - don’t feel like things are getting thrown away
