I work with a large variety of people and organisations. Here's some examples of the kinds of situation you might be in I can help with -- if in doubt, [get in touch](/contact) and let's have a chat.

## Campaigners, charities, and NGOs

Maybe you've been running a campaign for a while, and have some social media presence, and have now got a budget to do some web development. I can help you find effective ways to maximise your reach, make your cause easier to explain and understand, and create a digital and communications strategy for your organisation.

Maybe you're a more established organisation looking to experiment and find an innovative way to reach people or get your idea out. I can help turn your ideas into concrete, achievable realities.

Maybe your organisation has some awareness that it needs better technical tools to do its day-to-day work. I can review, identify and train your organisation to make best use of modern tools that help you work more efficiently.

## Universities, collages and schools



## Small businesses, including co-ops and CICs with ethical goals
